,,Emissions factors for air travel1 ,,,, 

,,Definition of short haul: less than ,,500,km
,,Definition of medium haul: less than ,,1600,km
,,Definition of long haul: more than,,1600,km

,,Method of Travel,kg CO2 per passenger km,kg CO2 per passenger mile,1 km equals,0.6214 [1],miles
,,UK short haul (approx.),0.15,0.24,1 mile equals,1.6093,km
,,UK medium haul (approx.),0.12,0.19
,,UK long haul (approx. ),0.11,0.18
,,"1) Air travel definitions and factors are from the GHG Protocol Mobile Combustion Tool.  The emissions factors for short and long haul flights are originally from UK DEFRA.  The emissions factor for medium haul flights was derived, using an assumed distance of 1600 km and the following formulae.
X+500y =.15*500 for short haul
X+5000y=.11*5000 for long haul
Based on Emission Factors provided by UK DEFRA (Table 9, Annexes to Guidelines for Company Reporting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, updated July 2005) for short haul and long haul flights

Note: these emissions factors are based on data from the UK.
