,"Lower heating values (LHV) were calculated from the higher heating values (HHV) contained in the API compendium based on the IPCC recommended relation:
For coals, oils and other liquid fuels, and biomass, energy in terms of LHV = energy in terms of HHV × 0.95
For gaseous fuels, energy in terms of LHV = energy in terms of HHV × 0.90"

,"** calculated based on LHV values contained in Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories:  Reference Manual Volume 3, Table 1-13; converted to HHV values based on the assumption that, for biomass fuels, LHV is 95% of HHV."
