<content>Congratulations for already choosing a ?green / renewable tariff? option.  You are already helping to increase demand for more clean, renewable energy supply in the UK.  However, because, generally, the renewable energy you are using has already been accounted for in the ? UK energy mix?, and the carbon intensity (ie the amount of carbon released due to each Kilowatt-hour of energy produced) of our fuel has been calculated to include that renewable supply , we still give you a CO2 rating for your electricity usage.</content>
