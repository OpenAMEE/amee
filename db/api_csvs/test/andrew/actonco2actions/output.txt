<content>Did you know that as much as 15% energy (and CO2) savings can be achieved by turning down the brightness and contrast levels on your TV? The manufacturer's settings are always set for showroom viewing, which is much brighter than needed for an average living room. This can amount to significant savings, particularly for larger flat-screen televisions, and will also improve the picture quality. It will also increase the lifespan of tubes, backlights and plasma elements.<br>If you are looking to buy a new TV, make sure that you buy an IDTV (Integrated Digital TV). It has the capacity to receive digital signals without the need for a set top box - this will save CO2 as you won't be powering a separate device to watch digital TV channels.</content>

<content>Air travel makes a growing contribution to CO2 emissions. Consider the need for a flight and the alternatives to taking a plane. If you do fly then consider offsetting your CO2.<br>If you can, travel by public transport to and from the airport. Rail links are usually quicker and easier than driving, and travelling by rail or bus may also save you money on parking.<br>Air travel currently accounts for 6.3% of the UK total CO2 emissions. The full climate impact of aviation goes beyond the effects of CO2 emissions, although there is still scientific uncertainty about the scale of the impacts of these effects. The climate impacts of non-CO2 emissions from flights (such as water vapour and nitrogen oxides) could mean the total impacts are larger (than those for CO2 alone) by a factor of 2-4 times, due to an effect known as radiative forcing.</content>

<isWellDone>FALSE</isWellDone>
<content>Typical mixed use of air conditioning can add around 5% to a car's fuel consumption and up to around 25% when working at full power - so use air conditioning sparingly. But remember that at speeds above 50-60mph it is generally more efficient to keep windows closed even if this means using aircon because open windows increase drag. Ordinary fan heaters/coolers generally have a lower impact on fuel consumption.</content>

<isWellDone>TRUE</isWellDone>
<content>Not only is a car sharing a great way to help reduce your CO2 emissions, it's a great way to save you money as well. By sharing the cost of driving one car you save on fuel, the cost of parking and wear and tear on a vehicle. Car sharing with just one person will reduce your emissions by half and with four people this rises to three-quarters. It will also help address congestion.</content>

<content>Erratic braking and accelerating uses more fuel than driving at a consistent speed. Drive at a good distance from the car in front, so you can anticipate and travel with the flow of traffic. Stay at or within the speed limit. This increases driver safety. It also reduces CO2 emissions and saves money on your petrol costs. At 70mph you could be using up to 9% more fuel than at 60mph and up to 15% more than at 50mph.</content>
