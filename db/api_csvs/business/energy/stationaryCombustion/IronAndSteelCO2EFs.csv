,"Source: 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The IPCC values were originally on a NCV (LHV) basis and have been converted to a GCV (HHV) basis using rule of thumb. Gross calorific (higher heating) values are preferred because they are more closely related to the carbon content of fuels than net calorific (lower heating) values.",,,,,,,
