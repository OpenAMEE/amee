Nearly 25% of car journeys are less than 2 miles, this considering cars consume most fuel at the start of their journey, means that the majority of the short journeys you make in your car are emitting more CO2 gas than usual. 

What you can do 
Walking or cycling for short journeys is not only good for your health but could also reduce your carbon footprint.

Car sharing is when two or more people travel in a car for a journey together. It not only reduces your CO2 emissions, but means you can share the costs of fuel, parking and wear and tear on the vehicle. Car sharing with just one person will reduce your emissions by half and with four people this rises to three-quarters.

What you can do
Think about times that you could car share, maybe to and from work with a colleague, to business meetings or when youâ€™re taking a longer journey to visit family and friends, or to a holiday destination.

What you can do
Instead of flying, consider travelling by rail or car. On average travelling by rail will result in about a third of the CO2 emissions of the equivalent domestic or short-haul flight in Europe.

Just one long haul return flight can give you the same (or larger) footprint as driving a car for an entire year.
