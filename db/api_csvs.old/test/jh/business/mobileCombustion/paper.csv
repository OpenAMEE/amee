,,Direct or Indirect - Mobile and Transportation Source Emissions
,,"Note: Emissions from stationary sources are reported on the ""Direct-Fuel Combust."" spreadsheet immediately in front of this spreadsheet"

,,"These spreadsheets include significant amounts of material copied from other WRI and WBCSD calculation tools. 
 Intellectual property rights of the WRI and WBCSD calculation tools belong to WRI and WBCSD, unless stated otherwise."

,,"This worksheet can be used to calculate emissions from mobile combustion sources, including transportation.
The worksheet contains three parts:
    Part 1 is used to calculate transportation emissions based on quantity of fuels consumed.
    Part 2 is used to calculate transportation emissions based on distance traveled.
    Part 3 is used to calculate emissions from non-transportation mobile sources such as harvesting equipment

WRI/WBCSD recommends the following approach. - For transportation emissions, because the data on fuel are generally more reliable, the estimation methods incorporated into Part 1 are preferred over those in Part 2 (distance-based).  Part 2 (the distance-based approach) should only be used as a last resort as it can introduce considerably higher levels of uncertainty in the CO2 estimates.

Be careful to avoid double counting!  If transportation emissions for a fleet are estimated using Part 1, do not also estimate emissions for this same fleet using Part 2.

Do not include any combustion sources on this page that were already addressed in the ""Direct - Fuel Combust."" sheet."
