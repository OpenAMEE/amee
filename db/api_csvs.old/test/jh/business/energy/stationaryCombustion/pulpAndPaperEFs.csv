,,"Note: Where mills are exporting CO2 to precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) plants, these exports are not considered emissions.  Amounts of exported CO2 are calculated in the sheet for ""CO2 Imports and Exports.""  On the ""Direct - Fuel Combustion"" sheet (this sheet), the amounts of exported CO2 are automatically subtracted from the sum of direct emissions from stationary fossil fuel combustion.  

Also, emissions from mobile sources are reported on the ""Direct - Mobile & Transportation"" spreadsheet immediately behind this spreadsheet

Facilities with boilers that are equiped with flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems may need to estimate CO2 emissions associated with limestone or dolomite consumption in these scrubbers.  These emissions may be estimated in the ""Make-up Chemicals"" worksheet."
