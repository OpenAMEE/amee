Compare the kWh figures before and after you act on the recommendations in this action plan, and see the difference it makes to your carbon footprint and your pocket.<br>If your winter heating bills are burning a hole in your pocket try turning down your thermostat by just one degree at a time. Each degree drop can reduce your bill by 10%. We recommend aiming for around 19-20 degrees celsius in your living room and around 18 degrees celsius in your bedroom.<br>Also think about the temperature on your immersion heater if you have one - can you reduce this by a degree or two?<br>Take care to set the timer control so that heating is only on at full temperature when there is somebody at home to benefit from it. If your home is occupied for different times each day of the week, consider getting a 7-day timer so that you can set different programmes depending on when people are at home.","<a target='_blank' href='http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/what_can_i_do_today/energy_saving_grants_and_offers'>Offers are available to help you save money on installing energy saving measures</a>",FALSE,"/home/energy/quantity:EMPTY","/home/energy/uk/price:EMPTY",,5,"<strong>Check your fuel bills for your real energy useage - you might be using less than is estimated</strong>",7,,"defra 2008",
