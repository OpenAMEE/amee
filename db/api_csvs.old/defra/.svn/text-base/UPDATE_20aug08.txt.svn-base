Heating
=======
Heating entries were ranked by % difference between old and
new - see data-heating_diff.ods-  then update was done
on the resulting data-heating.csv.

The original file is data-heating_orig.csv.

Heating stopped at following entry:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> i = 1315    key       = Detached 
House&1&Gas&Post 1995&Boiler (average - 5-10yrs old)

Corresponding to row 1316 of data-heating_diff.ods

This means that rows 2 to 1316 of data-heating.csv were applied
to defra.co2.dgen.net. Rows 1317-end are same as old version,
see backup/data-heating.csv_datetime.
