Many problems uploading this data.
data_orig.csv is original
data.csv is fixed that will upload, but missing things:

max char limit of 255
& and £ chars causes problems
<br> in any flights content had to be removed
<links> had to be deleted - e.g. no cavity insulation link have a problem

Could be no xml happy tags, like <br>? Yes - defo!
